States</span></b></p>

<p>United States has the largest annual number of tornado
events than anywhere else in the world (Goliger &amp; Milford, 1998), with an
average count over 1,000 tornado touchdowns according to the record of past
decade. Most tornadoes have speeds less than 110 miles per hour, stretch
approximately 250 feet across, and stay on the ground for a few miles. The
extreme ones can be more than 300 mph, with more than two miles in width and
dozens of miles in length.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Most of tornadoes occur in the so called Alley region. This
region stretches across the Central Plains from Minnesota to Wyoming to Texas.
Tornadoes can cause fatalities or injuries as well as property damages at the
same time. However, Tornado is still hard to forecast accurately (Johns &amp;
Doswell III, 1992; Simmons &amp; Sutter, 2005) and a large number of people
live in that area, that kind of events result in huge damages to this country
every year (Simmons &amp; Sutter, 2011).&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>As we can image, strong tornado (EF2-EF3) and violent tornado (EF4-EF5) should be fatal whenever it happens. However, weak tornado (EF0-EF1), especially EF0 tornado, which usually leaves only a small track with minor damages, is relative less impacts to economy and society. Furthermore, as population and economic grow rapidly in recent years, more and more people begin to live in the tornado prone area, the exposure to this perils increases dramatically.</p>

<p>Thus, several questions could be asked:</p>

<p>Are there more and more losses from tornado increasing year by year?  Do we have more losses now than past? What kind of tornado mainly contributes to those losses?</p>

<p>To address above questions, this study analyzed tornado data between 1950-2015 from both visualization and model perspective. For more informatin, please see the slides at <a href="http://www.rpubs.com/Luo/tornado">http://http://www.rpubs.com/Luo/tornado</a></p></p>
